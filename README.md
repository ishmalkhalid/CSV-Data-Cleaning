## Conclusion

Yes , the calculations do answer my questions. However, I believe this analysis can be more substansive if we break up the analysis into different parts and include a seperate analysis for different/across years, different/across genders, different/across countries. Furthermore, the calculation for population mean holds no true importance since the population mean is for the for each country inclusive of 37 years and all age groups and genders i.e. it double counts the same people each year.
